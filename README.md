# Spam-mail-prediction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whether an email is spam or not. The model is trained using a dataset of labeled emails and leverages various natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract features from the email text.
The model is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The evaluation results are used to fine-tune the model for better performance.
